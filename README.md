# Mastering-SQL-Techniques-Capstone
In this project, I embarked on a journey to sharpen my SQL skills using a real-world airline database. It was a comprehensive exploration covering a wide range of SQL concepts, from the basics to more advanced techniques.

1. Foundational Queries: I began by practicing fundamental SQL queries to extract essential data from tables like bookings, passengers, and flights. This helped me establish a strong understanding of SQL syntax and database navigation.

2. Harnessing Aggregation Functions: As I progressed, I delved into the world of aggregation functions, using tools like COUNT and SUM to analyze data trends. This allowed me to calculate critical metrics such as total revenue, seat counts, and flight frequencies.

3. Mastering Joins: One of the highlights was mastering JOIN statements, enabling me to merge data from multiple tables seamlessly. By combining information from flights, aircrafts, and airports, I gained deeper insights into flight operations and passenger behavior.

4. Tackling Advanced Challenges: I took on more complex SQL challenges, such as identifying specific flight details based on criteria like ranges, aircraft types, and cancellation statuses. This pushed me to think critically and apply SQL techniques creatively.

5. Using Conditional Functions: Lastly, I explored conditional functions to filter and manipulate data based on various conditions. Whether it was extracting date-wise insights or analyzing passenger statuses, I learned to wield SQL's power with precision.

Through this project, I honed my SQL skills to a razor-sharp level. I gained confidence in querying databases, manipulating data, and deriving actionable insights. This newfound expertise is not only invaluable for my current projects but also lays a strong foundation for future data analysis endeavors.

In conclusion, this project was an enriching experience that empowered me with practical SQL knowledge applicable across diverse industries and scenarios.
